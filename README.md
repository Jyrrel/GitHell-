# GitHell  

**Welcome to the Abyss**—a realm where fairness is an illusion and auto-commits rule the shadows. GitHell is not here to play nice; it’s here to expose the exploiters of GitHub's metrics.  

---

## ⚔️ **Purpose**  

*"You thought your auto-commits made you untouchable? Welcome to the chaos."*  

GitHell is designed to counteract the auto-commit phenomenon with equal parts irony and rebellion. It turns the tables on exploiters, proving that dirty strategies don’t lead to real victories.

## 🕹️ **Workflow Overview**  

- **Frequent Commits**: The workflow generates commits every 5 minutes or on demand.  
- **Execution Tracker**: Each run updates a file documenting:
  - Total Commits  
  - Execution Count  
  - Last Execution Time  
  - Unique Commit ID  
- **Commit Message**: Every commit mocks the unfair strategies it challenges.  

Example:  
> _"Think you’re clever? Think again. 😈 (Commits: 512, Executions: 742, Last run: 2024-12-30T16:00:00Z)"_
